# Projects in progress - NSSF DAF

NSSF DAF: Network Slice Selection Function Decision-Aid Framework

+ The NSSF DAF consists of a solution that runs in user equipment (e.g. smartphones, vehicles, IoT brokers) in the background and at the edge of the network operator or service provider. The framework has several modules that can be configured according to the context of applications, geographic location, scenarios of mobility, strategies of slices selection, among others. For energy saving, the user equipment only signals its consumption profile or user application preference to the framework host.

# Projects in progress - NWDAF

NWDAF: Network Data Analytics Function

+ The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) implement the analysis functions and the data mining pipeline in 5G Networks and beyond.
