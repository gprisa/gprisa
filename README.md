# Grupo de Pesquisa em Redes Inteligentes e Sistemas AutÃ´nomos ðŸ“¶

The research group on Intelligent Networks and Autonomous Systems (RINAS) focuses on the development of new methods and tools for the analysis, design and optimization of communication networks and systems. The group has expertise in several areas, including:

- Wireless Networks
- Ad hoc and Sensor Networks
- Network Simulation and Modeling
- Queueing Theory
- Optimization Theory
- Control Theory
- Game Theory
- Optimization for Resource Allocation in 5G and 6G Networks;
- Cross-Layer Design for 5G and 6G Networks;
- Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz Communications for 5G Networks;
- Green and Sustainable 5G Networks;
- Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) for 5G Networks;
- Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for 5G Networks.

## This research group is composed of the following members:

 - Douglas Chagas, lÃ­der do grupo;
 - Jean Nunes, pesquisador;
